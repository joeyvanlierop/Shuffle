<h1 align=center>Shuffle Algorithm</h1>

## About The Project

This small program was designed to produce a shuffled array of integers. It accomplishes this by implementing the modern version of the [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle). 

## Project Structure:
There are two classes in this project:
 - Shuffle:
    - Contains a single static method named shuffle. The method takes in an integer "n" and produces an array with the integers 1 to "n" in a random order. 
 - ShuffleTest:
    - Contains the tests that are responsible for testing the shuffle method.
## Task list:
 - [ ] General Optimizations
 - [ ] Comments
 - [ ] Random number distribution analysis
 - [ ] (Maybe) Translate to a more efficient language
